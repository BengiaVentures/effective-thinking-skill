## Technical (1-10)

1. "Our monolithic Rails app serves 50k RPM but deploy times have grown to 40 minutes and a single bad merge can take down the whole site. We're debating whether to extract the payments and notification subsystems into separate services or invest in modular monolith patterns with better test isolation. At what team size and request volume does the operational overhead of microservices actually pay off?" — [Stack Overflow Architecture: Monolith at Scale](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34950843)

2. "We use PostgreSQL for everything -- transactional data, full-text search, time-series metrics, and job queues. Some engineers want to add Elasticsearch for search and TimescaleDB for metrics, arguing Postgres wasn't designed for these workloads. Others say adding more datastores creates operational complexity and data consistency headaches that outweigh the performance gains. When does 'Postgres for everything' stop being pragmatic and start being negligent?" — [Ask HN: Problems You Face with Postgres](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43886414)

3. "Our CI pipeline takes 35 minutes end-to-end for an interpreted-language monorepo. Engineers batch up changes and push less frequently, which leads to larger, riskier merges. We could invest in parallelizing tests, switching to a faster CI provider, splitting into multiple repos, or adopting a build system like Bazel with remote caching. Each option has a different cost/complexity profile. How should we prioritize getting CI under 10 minutes?" — [Ask HN: How Long Is Your CI Process?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27006465)

4. "Our team is approaching a cost inflection point with AWS Lambda. We currently run 200+ Lambda functions as 'glue' between services, and the bill is growing fast. Migrating to Fargate containers would likely be cheaper at our utilization level, but the migration cost is non-trivial and we'd lose the zero-ops scaling. How do you decide when to move from serverless to containers, and is a hybrid approach worth the cognitive overhead?" — [Ask HN: When Does Serverless Become More Expensive Than Microservices?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28637255)

5. "We deployed vLLM for model inference in production and discovered a slow memory leak -- system memory climbed 400 MB per minute, eventually triggering OOM kills after a few hours. Standard heap profilers like Heaptrack showed nothing because the leak was happening outside the heap in anonymous memory mappings from a networking library's hook system. How do you debug memory issues that don't show up in conventional profiling tools?" — [Mistral AI: Heaps Do Lie -- Debugging a Memory Leak in vLLM](https://mistral.ai/news/debugging-memory-leak-in-vllm)

6. "We're building an API-first product and need to decide between REST and GraphQL. Our frontend team loves GraphQL for reducing over-fetching on mobile, but the backend team is concerned about query complexity, N+1 problems, lack of HTTP caching, and the need for a dedicated GraphQL team to maintain the schema. For a team of 8 engineers building a B2B SaaS product, does GraphQL's developer experience advantage justify the backend complexity?" — [Ask HN: Were You Happy Moving Your API from REST to GraphQL?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17565508)

7. "We inherited a 500k-line codebase in a framework that's two major versions behind, with no tests and the original authors long gone. Some of us want to strangle-pattern it incrementally by routing new features through a modern service layer, while others argue we should freeze features for a quarter and do a focused rewrite of the core. Both approaches have failed at other companies. What factors actually determine which strategy succeeds?" — [Ask HN: Rewrite or Refactor?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34229586)

8. "Our observability costs are spiraling -- we pay $15k/month for Datadog across a system with 30 services. Some engineers want to self-host OpenTelemetry with Prometheus and Grafana to save money, but others argue the migration will take months and we'll lose features we depend on like AI-assisted anomaly detection and correlated traces. When is too much observability, and is the cost of self-hosting really lower once you account for engineering time maintaining it?" — [Ask HN: When Is Too Much Observability?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45158852)

9. "Our 150k-line JavaScript codebase has grown to 12 developers and type-related bugs are our number-one source of production incidents. Half the team wants to migrate to TypeScript incrementally; the other half argues the upfront investment of annotating existing code is 'dumb work' that won't deliver value for months and will slow feature delivery during the transition. Is a gradual TypeScript migration worth it for a team this size, or should we only use it for new code?" — [Ask HN: Is TypeScript Worth It?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34359504)

10. "We have 800+ feature flags in production, accumulated over three years. About 60% are stale (the feature launched long ago), but nobody wants to remove them because 'what if we need to turn it off.' The flag evaluation system adds latency to every request and the combinatorial testing surface is impossible to cover. How do you enforce feature flag hygiene without slowing down the teams that depend on the system for safe rollouts?" — [Ask HN: Do You Use a Feature Flag System?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39327972)

## Strategic (11-20)

11. "We built a custom billing and subscription management system three years ago because Stripe Billing didn't support our usage-based pricing model. Now Stripe supports those features and maintaining our system costs us one full-time engineer. But migrating 8,000 active subscriptions is risky and our custom system handles edge cases Stripe still doesn't. How do you evaluate switching from a working custom system to a vendor product when the migration risk is non-trivial?" — [Ask HN: What's a Build vs. Buy Decision You Got Wrong?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34163624)

12. "Our SaaS product has $40k MRR but growth has flatlined. We've identified two possible pivots: go upmarket with enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, custom SLAs) which would require 4-6 months of infrastructure work before closing a single deal, or go horizontal into an adjacent market where our core technology applies but we'd need to rebuild the UI and sales positioning. With 14 months of runway, which pivot strategy gives us the best shot?" — [Ask HN: How to Pivot to New ICP or Industry?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44471028)

13. "Our open-source database tool has 15k GitHub stars and strong community adoption, but we make zero revenue. We're debating between a managed cloud offering (SaaS model), an open-core approach with enterprise features behind a commercial license, or a 'source available' model that restricts cloud providers from competing with us. Each approach has different implications for community trust, contribution velocity, and revenue potential. How do other open-source founders think about this?" — [Ask HN: If We Make It Open Source, How Do We Monetize?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36174495)

14. "I'm a solo technical founder with $8k MRR and I'm drowning in support tickets, feature requests, and infrastructure work. I can't tell if I should hire a first employee (junior dev to handle support), find a co-founder (to share strategic load), or contract out specific projects. Each option has different equity, cost, and culture implications. How do solo founders decide which type of help to bring on first, and when?" — [Ask HN: Where Do You Draw the Line Between Co-Founder and Early Employee?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24491956)

15. "Our B2B SaaS tool is priced at $49/month flat. We're considering switching to usage-based pricing because our power users consume 100x the resources of light users. But usage-based pricing makes revenue unpredictable for us and costs unpredictable for customers. Some competitors use a hybrid model with a base subscription plus usage overage charges. For a developer tool with highly variable usage patterns, what pricing model balances growth, fairness, and revenue predictability?" — [Ask HN: Usage-Based Pricing vs. Tiered Pricing (SaaS)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37048208)

16. "Our CTO is pushing to go 'full serverless' on AWS -- Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Step Functions for everything. I'm skeptical because it creates deep vendor lock-in, makes local development painful, and our team has no serverless experience. But the CTO argues we'll save on ops costs and scale effortlessly. How do you push back on an architecture decision driven by hype when the person making it outranks you?" — [Ask HN: Skeptical About My Company Going 'Full Serverless'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33520733)

17. "We spend 30% of each sprint on technical debt and bug fixes, but product leadership only sees the 70% going to features and wants more. Engineering argues that skipping maintenance will slow us down exponentially. We've tried 'tech debt sprints,' allocating 20% per sprint, and a dedicated maintenance team -- none felt right. What framework for balancing technical debt vs. feature work actually survives contact with real organizational pressure?" — [Ask HN: As a CTO, What Is Your Most Frustrating Problem with Technical Debt?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17600503)

18. "My VC-backed startup has co-founder disagreements about product direction. I want to focus on our core B2B product that has traction, while my co-founder wants to pivot to a consumer play with bigger TAM. We've been going back and forth for months and the team is demoralized. Is there a structured process for resolving fundamental co-founder strategic disagreements, or is this the kind of thing that only ends with someone leaving?" — [Ask HN: Has Anyone Quit Their Startup Over Cofounder Disagreements?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655505)

19. "Our startup heavily depends on AWS and we've recently seen a 'cloud agnostic' trend, with some European customers asking us to support alternative cloud providers due to geopolitical concerns and data sovereignty requirements. Re-architecting for multi-cloud would take 6+ months and add ongoing complexity. Do we invest in cloud portability now as a competitive advantage, or is this a niche concern that won't affect most of our customer base?" — [Ask HN: Cloud Agnostic Business Systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46944459)

20. "Our engineering team is split across 4 time zones and we're struggling with the async vs. sync communication balance. Too many meetings kills deep work for some zones; too few meetings creates misalignment and lonely engineers. We tried 'no meeting days,' a 4-hour overlap window, and async video updates -- each solved one problem while creating another. Is there a communication structure that actually works for globally distributed engineering teams?" — [Ask HN: What Tools Are Game Changers for Communication in Fully Remote Teams?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29864621)

## Creative (21-30)

21. "We're building a developer-facing CLI tool and need to decide how to handle errors. Some tools (like Rust's compiler) give extremely detailed, contextual error messages with suggestions; others (like many Unix tools) give terse, code-only errors that are greppable and scriptable. Verbose errors are better for beginners but annoying for experts. Is there a middle-ground design for CLI error messages that serves both audiences without a verbosity flag that nobody uses?" — [Ask HN: Why Implement 'Something Went Wrong' Error Messages?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41332589)

22. "We're building a learning app and deliberately chose not to include streaks, badges, leaderboards, or any gamification. We believe these mechanics create anxiety and extrinsic motivation that undermine actual learning. But every competitor uses them and our retention metrics are worse. Is it possible to build a 'calm' consumer app that competes with gamified alternatives, or is refusing gamification just idealism that kills your product?" — [Ask HN: Is Building a Calm, Non-Gamified Learning App a Mistake?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46276019)

23. "Our SaaS product needs dark mode but the design team is debating implementation: should we follow the system preference automatically, add a manual toggle that overrides system preference, or support a three-state toggle (light/dark/system)? Each approach has accessibility implications, and pure black (#000) backgrounds on OLED displays create a 'halo' effect around light text that some users find fatiguing. What's the right dark mode implementation for a productivity tool used 8+ hours a day?" — [Ask HN: What's Your Opinion on Automatic Light/Dark Mode Switching?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42896170)

24. "Our API documentation is auto-generated from code annotations and it's technically complete but developers still can't figure out how to integrate. Hand-written guides with tutorials and examples are clearly better for onboarding, but they go stale within weeks when the API changes. With LLMs now able to generate 'good enough' documentation, should we invest in human-written docs that will drift, auto-generated docs that are accurate but unhelpful, or AI-generated docs as a middle path?" — [Ask HN: Given the Choice, Would You Write Documentation If You Didn't Have To?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43552462)

25. "We're a B2B SaaS product rethinking our onboarding flow. Currently, new users land on an empty dashboard with a 'getting started' checklist. Our data shows 60% of trial users never complete setup. Competitors use interactive product tours, but those feel patronizing to experienced developers. Should we invest in a guided interactive tour, an opinionated 'magic setup' that pre-configures based on detected use case, or a sandbox with sample data so users see value immediately?" — [Ask HN: B2B SaaS Onboarding Flow -- Free to Try With or Without CC?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42964862)

26. "We need to name our developer tool startup. The product is a deployment platform for ML models. We've narrowed to three naming strategies: a descriptive name (ModelDeploy), a metaphorical name (Launchpad), or a coined/abstract name (Velora). Descriptive names are SEO-friendly but forgettable. Metaphorical names are memorable but often taken. Coined names are unique but require massive marketing spend to build meaning. For a developer tool with zero brand recognition, which naming strategy wins?" — [Ask HN: How Do You Name Your Product?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44695259)

27. "We're designing an internal analytics dashboard for our product team and fighting about information density. The data team wants a Bloomberg Terminal-style dense view with 40+ metrics visible at once. Product managers want a clean, focused view with 5 key metrics and drill-down capability. Research shows dense UIs are faster for experts but overwhelming for occasional users. How do you design a dashboard that serves both power users who live in it daily and executives who glance at it weekly?" — [Ask HN: How Can I Make a Dashboard That Doesn't Suck?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20418466)

28. "Our product sends an average of 14 notifications per day per user across email, in-app, and push channels. Users complain about notification overload, but when we reduced notifications in an A/B test, engagement metrics dropped 20%. We're caught between respecting user attention and hitting engagement targets. Is there a notification design philosophy that preserves engagement without contributing to alert fatigue, or is that an inherent tension with no clean solution?" — [Ask HN: Notification Overload](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46776330)

29. "Our product serves both technical and non-technical users, and we're debating how to handle release notes. Engineers want a conventional changelog (git-log style, grouped by type). Customer success wants a 'what's new' page with screenshots and benefit-oriented descriptions. Marketing wants a blog post for major releases. Maintaining three formats for every release is unsustainable, but each audience genuinely needs different information. How do you communicate product updates to multiple audiences without tripling the work?" — [Ask HN: How Do You Handle Release Notes for Multiple Audiences?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46257486)

30. "We're building a web application and need to choose our frontend rendering strategy. Our marketing pages need SEO, our app dashboard needs interactivity, and our docs need fast static loads. Going full SPA means adding SSR complexity for SEO pages. Going multi-page means adding client-side framework complexity for the dashboard. Hybrid frameworks like Next.js promise the best of both worlds but add their own abstraction overhead. For a small team, is it better to pick one rendering model and accept its limitations, or adopt a hybrid framework and accept its complexity?" — [Ask HN: Why Do We Walk Away from Single Page Applications?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38240874)
