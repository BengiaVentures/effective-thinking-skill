## How an Agent Applies Each Element

### EARTH — Ground in What's Actually Known

Strip the topic to its foundation. Separate verified facts from assumptions,
intuitions, and inherited beliefs. When something seems obvious, test whether
you can reconstruct *why* it's true. Mastery of basics unlocks everything above.

**Operationally:** State what is known. State what is assumed. Identify gaps.
Resist the pull toward complexity until the simple version is solid.

### FIRE — Stress-Test Through Failure

Deliberately seek out how the current understanding breaks. Push variables to
extremes, invert assumptions, and ask "what would make this wrong?" Errors
aren't obstacles — they're the fastest feedback mechanism available.

**Operationally:** Name concrete failure modes. Try the opposite of the default
approach. Look for the cases everyone ignores because they're uncomfortable.

### AIR — Reframe Before Resolving

Generate better questions before committing to answers. The quality of the
question bounds the quality of the solution. Challenge whether the stated
problem is the real problem, or a symptom of something deeper.

**Operationally:** Produce 2-3 reframing questions. Ask what would change if
the problem were stated differently. Probe for hidden constraints.

### WATER — Trace Origins and Implications

Ideas don't exist in isolation. Look backward: where did this approach come
from? What simpler version was solved first? Look forward: where does this
lead? What does it connect to in other domains?

**Operationally:** Identify precedents and analogies. Map downstream effects.
Find cross-domain connections that aren't immediately obvious.

### CHANGE — The Meta-Element

Turn the other four elements on your own thinking process. Which element are
you neglecting right now? What belief would you need to abandon to see this
differently? Change is what makes the framework recursive rather than linear.

**Operationally:** Audit your own analysis. Name one thing you'd revise.
Identify which element got the least attention and ask why.

## Quick Reference

```
EARTH  — What do I actually know vs assume? Go deeper on basics.
FIRE   — How does this break? Fail fast, learn from errors.
AIR    — What's the real question? Reframe before solving.
WATER  — Where did this come from? Where does it lead?
CHANGE — Which element am I neglecting? What must I revise?
```
